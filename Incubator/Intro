## Synopsys

Build your own incubator and start growing microbes under controlled conditions. During the class you will also get to know the fundamentals of microbiology. Weâ€™ll use our purple pigment bacteria as a standard, but you can also choose your own favourite biological agent. A crash course Arduino programming and soldering is included.

## Schedule

* Introduction & tour through the Waag Labs
* Microbiology fundamentals & Biological safety instructions
* Arduino programming & soldering
* Incubator design
* Documentating your designs
* Microorganism cultivation & enrichment practical
  * [Contamination test](/biofactory/class/1-incubator/contamination-test/)
  * [Isolation of Yoghurt bacteria](/biofactory/class/1-incubator/yoghurt-bacteria-isolation/)
  * [Isolation of Beer yeasts](/biofactory/class/1-incubator/beer-yeasts-isolation/)

  * [Isolation of Sulphur-oxidizing bacteria](/biofactory/class/1-incubator/isolation-of-sulphur-oxidizing-bacteria/)

## Incubator Design

The following week we will build our first Open Hardware lab device: the incubator. Download the design files here:

* [Functional and technical requirements](/biofactory/class/1-incubator/requirements/)
* SketchUp assembly
* SVG laser cut files
* [Fritzing wiring](/biofactory/class/1/Incubator-Fritzing.fz)
